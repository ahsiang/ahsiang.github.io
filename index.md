I am a **computational evolutionary paleobiologist** who is primarily interested in developing novel methodologies and tools in order to answer questions about **macroevolutionary dynamics in deep time.**

Currently, I am a researcher at Stockholm University in the <a href="https://www.su.se/department-of-ecology-environment-and-plant-sciences/" target="_blank">Department of Ecology, Environment and Plant Sciences</a> (DEEP). I am working on applying deep learning and computer vision towards understanding the evolution of pollen in response to evolutionary transitions between pollination modes. This work is part of the project "<a href="https://www.su.se/english/research/research-projects/harnessing-evolutionary-transitions-machine-learning-and-genomics-to-decode-pollen?open-collapse-boxes=" target="_blank">Harnessing evolutionary transitions, machine learning, and genomics to decode pollen</a>", on which I am a co-PI. This project is supported by a grant awarded by the <a href="https://kaw.wallenberg.org/" target="_blank">Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation</a>.

My research uses **machine learning, high-throughput imaging, and statistical modelling** to understand morphological evolution and macroevolutionary patterns and processes. I am particularly interested in bringing a next-generation approach (<em>e.g.</em>, automated Big data collection) to studying **morphological evolution**.

I work with both **vertebrate and invertebrate systems**. Taxonomic groups I have worked with include turtles, squamate lizards, birds, mammals, planktonic foraminifera, and angiosperms (flowering plants).

By bridging the fields of **computer science and evolutionary biology**, I aim to deliver a unique and creative perspective towards understanding evolution and the history of life on earth.
