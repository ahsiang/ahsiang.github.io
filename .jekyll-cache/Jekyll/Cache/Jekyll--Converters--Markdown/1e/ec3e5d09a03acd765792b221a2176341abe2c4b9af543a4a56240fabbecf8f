I am a <strong>computational evolutionary paleobiologist</strong> who is primarily interested in developing novel methodologies and tools in order to answer questions about <strong>macroevolutionary dynamics in deep time.</strong></p>

<p>Currently, I am an early career researcher at Stockholm University in the <a href="https://www.su.se/geo/english/" target="_blank">Department of Geological Sciences</a> (IGV), working on applying deep learning and computer vision to understanding the morphological evolution of planktonic foraminifer communities across the K-Pg boundary. This project is supported by a starting grant within natural and engineering sciences awarded by the <a href="https://www.vr.se/" target="_blank">Swedish Research Council</a>.</p>

My research uses <strong>machine learning, high-throughput imaging, and statistical modelling</strong> to understand morphological evolution and macroevolutionary patterns and processes. I am particularly interested in bringing a â€˜next-generationâ€™ approach (<em>e.g.</em>, automated Big data collection) to studying <strong>morphological evolution in deep time</strong>.</p>

<p>I work with both <strong>vertebrate and invertebrate systems</strong>. Taxonomic groups I have worked with include turtles, squamate lizards, birds, mammals, and planktonic foraminifera.</p>

<p>By bridging the fields of <strong>computer science and evolutionary biology</strong>, I aim to deliver a unique and creative perspective towards understanding evolution and the history of life on earth.</p>
